### Hello, my name is Julieta, 

I am a Biotechnology student at the National University of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

I am especially interested in the fields of Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Synthetic Biology. I have had the opportunity to participate in research groups focused on biological system simulations, protein modeling, and even neural network development.

ðŸš€ What I Do

I use GitHub to share what I am learning and building, especially in data analysis with Python.
Some of my projects include:

Mini-projects in Python

Basic tutorials on Python libraries

Ongoing projects on the analysis of molecular dynamics of biological membranes.

ðŸ“š Continuous Learning

I was fortunate to take free programming courses through initiatives such as Argentina Programa, which gave me a solid foundation in Python and data analysis. Although such opportunities are no longer widely available, I remain committed to self-learning. I collect and study open courses, guides, books, and documentation, and I aim to share part of this journey here.

ðŸ’¡ Why GitHub?

My goal is not only to showcase my own learning process, but also to create resources that may help others starting out in Python, bioinformatics, and computational biology. If even one of my projects helps someone else, it will be worth it!
