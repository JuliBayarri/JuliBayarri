### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JuliBayarri/JuliBayarri** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, some BigData analysis and Bioinfermatic
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics projects
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: julieta.bayarri@mi.unc.edu.ar
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My native language is not English, I am from Argentina, I can understand English but I may not be as good at writing or speaking, I hope you can understand.
I am a Biotechnology student and I am learning programming and bioinformatics by myself.
